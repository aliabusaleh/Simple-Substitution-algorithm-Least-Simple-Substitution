In the following assume that the input plaintext is in capital English letters (A-Z).
_One main program for both questions_. **Make a menu list to choose from.** No need for a graphical
user interface. Use **_C++ or Java_** , but you cannot use predefined libraries for encryption or analysis.

1. Write a program that will ask the user to enter a plaintext of any length and a key (a positive
    integer), then it will print out on the screen the encoded ciphertext using the **Simple**
    **Substitution** algorithm, and show the decryption step. Your program should be able to **crack**
    the ciphertext and obtain the original plain text too. Print out all **analysis** results. Show three
    options, Encrypt, Decrypt and Crack.


2. Write a program that will ask the user to enter any plaintext. Then, it will encrypt that string
    using **Least-Simple Substitution** and prints out the results on the screen. Try to use
    **Cryptanalysis II** in the slides to show the frequency counts of the letters. Briefly show some
    analysis if you can successfully find **some** letters in their original text. The length of the string
    must be big enough to make the analysis feasible.
Check the following link for help deciding the frequency count of The English letters.
